*NPCNAME* "Good to see you, *NAME*!
As you are aware I've been studying the recent worrysome levels of radiation that have been detected in wildlife around Terethia. 
We think that there may be something in the natural environment that is causing these high measurements, and if so we need to identify it and control it.
I'm sure you've also seen the increasing reports around the country of sightings of large numbers of undocumented species that display particularly aggressive behaviour.
We think that there may be a correlation between these observations - as the areas with high radiation contain more aggressive species.
For your first task I need you to collect a sample of some *YELLOW*Protomeebium*/YELLOW* we've been studying from Rifton Cave to the west of the village.
We think there's organic matter in this substance - and we'd like to take a look at the impact of the radiation on the organics inside.
Our lab gets funding when we progress our research, so you should receive your first paycheck once we find out more about the *YELLOW*Protomeebium.*/YELLOW*
I'll provide you with a flashlight - be careful, there may be some of those aggressive creatures in there!"

*NPCNAME* "Are you having trouble finding the *YELLOW*Protomeebium*/YELLOW*? It's in the depths of Rifton Cave.
Head to the west of the village to get there."
END
//found protomeebium

*NPCNAME* "Yes! That's the *YELLOW*Protomeebium*/YELLOW* alright! I'll begin studying straight away. 
You should try to investigate the origins of this material too, *NAME*. The *YELLOW*library*/YELLOW* may be able to provide an insight.
I think they have some books on *YELLOW*Protomeebium*/YELLOW* in there."
END

*NPCNAME* "...Excellent! What did you learn from your studies? 
...
...
...
So, you say according to research the organics within the *YELLOW*Protomeebium*/YELLOW* will react under catalysis with certain substances?
... And irradiated substances tend to produce the most intense reactions?
I wonder...I have been studying this *YELLOW*Ellondite*/YELLOW* for some time due to its levels of radiation.
It was found close to the *YELLOW*Protomeebium*/YELLOW* site and seems to match the description in the book."
*GREY*Dr. Tanaka passes a sample of Ellondite to Dr. Digby, who places it somewhere within the depths of the machinery.
*GREY*The machine begins to make a humming noise and symbols on the machine's display unit flicker on and off.
*GREY*After a few minutes Dr. Digby opens the machine and stares at the contents in awe.
*NPCNAME* "WHAT?! There are LIVING CREATURES in here?! This reaction appears to have initiated some form of accelerated evolution on the organic matter."
*GREY*Dr. Digby carefully removes the creatures and performs a number of measurements on them.
*NPCNAME* "*NAME*, can I give these to you to study? Please keep track of any changes you see in them. 
I shall name them *YELLOW*Meeba*/YELLOW* after the substance they formed from. These may well be pivotal to understanding the creatures that have begun to appear throughout Terethia."
*GREY*You gained two of Dr. Digby's Meeba. They will assist you in battle, and can be accessed through the menu.
"The Meeba should be able to provide some defense against the monsters outside the village too."
*GREY*Dr. Tanaka is looking perplexed and looks like she wants to talk to you.
END

END
//found ellondite

*NPCNAME* "You found more*YELLOW*Ellondite*/YELLOW*? Excellent! I was starting to worry we'd never be able to re-produce these results.
We've been doing a little research while you were away, and have made some progress with understanding the Meeba.
It seems that along with the accelerated evolution they show, Meeba may be able to adapt to and incorporate elements of their surroundings."
Dr.Tanaka "Previously we've been able to combine substances collected from creatures to make *YELLOW*'roots'*/YELLOW*.Roots maintain the essence of the creature they were created from, and we think that we may be able to use them alongside the Ellondite in order to direct the evolutionary pathway of the Meeba!
This kind of evolution has never been seen in nature - and we think without our modern technology it wouldn't be possible. We're going to have to seriously think about the implications associated with such a power."
*NPCNAME* "Let's get straight to it! Hopefully you already collected some substances on your travels - they tend to be dropped by creatures after encounters. If not could you collect some samples now for us?
Dr.Tanaka "When you have your samples ready, access the lab computer over there and combine them in the *YELLOW*GRAFTING menu*/YELLOW*. You can type exit in any menu to return to the previous menu.
Then, access the *YELLOW*DNA menu*/YELLOW*,
and select *YELLOW*SPLICE*/YELLOW* and we'll see what happens!"
END
//spliced first meeba

*NPCNAME* "This is incredible! Not only has the Meeba evolved into a new species, but it has taken on characteristics of the creatures that the *YELLOW*root*/YELLOW* was created from.
This solidifies your mission, *NAME*. Go forth and search the world for more *YELLOW*Ellondite!*/YELLOW* Collect samples from creatures from lands far and wide! We will study these Meeba and discover the nature of their power!
You should head over to *YELLOW*Karstbay*/YELLOW* - one of my colleagues has a lab over there. I'll send her over the information we've gathered so far and you'll be able to set up base there.
There's a boat that travels from *YELLOW*Rifton Beach*/YELLOW* to Karstbay regularly."

Since Dr. Digby contacted me about the *YELLOW*Ellondite*/YELLOW* and its effect on the protomeebium we've been trying to track down more localities of the rock.
It seems that only certain samples of the rock have the properties we are interested in, and that is dependant on the level of radiation within it.
So, now our next task is to study and identify this rock more thoroughly in order to track down other outcrops of it.
Currently we know that the rock contains very *YELLOW*high levels of uranium*/YELLOW*.
I had this *YELLOW*detector*/YELLOW* custom made to detect radiation from uranium in nearby rock outcrops.
It shows high readings near the *YELLOW*limestone caves*/YELLOW* in Karstbay, so maybe there is an outcrop of the rock there.
