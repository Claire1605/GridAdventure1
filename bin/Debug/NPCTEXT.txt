For your first task I need you to collect a sample of some *YELLOW*Protomeebium*/YELLOW* we've been studying from Rifton Cave to the west of the village.
Our lab gets funding when we progress our research, so you should receive your first paycheck once we find out more about the *YELLOW*Protomeebium.*/YELLOW*
I'll provide you with a flashlight - be careful, there are violent monsters in there!"

*NPCNAME* "...This *YELLOW*Protomeebium*/YELLOW* book is EXACTLY what I've been looking for! Ahh! According to this research, the *YELLOW*Protomeebium*/YELLOW*requires a catlayst in order to begin accelerated evolution...
I wonder...I have been studying this *YELLOW*Ellondite*/YELLOW* for some time due to its rarity.
It was found close to the *YELLOW*Protomeebium*/YELLOW* site and seems to match the description in the book."
*GREY*Dr. Tanaka passes the Ellondite to Dr. Digby, who places it somewhere within the depths of the machinery.
*NPCNAME* "Amazing! The reaction has created life! I shall name them *YELLOW*Meeba*/YELLOW* after the substance they formed from.
*NAME*, can I give these to you to study? Please keep track of any changes you see in them."

*NPCNAME* "You found another *YELLOW*Ellondite*/YELLOW*?? I was starting to worry we'd never be able to re-produce these results.
We've been doing a little research while you were away, and have made some progress with understanding the Meeba.
It seems that Meeba may be able to adapt to their surroundings at speeds on par with the evolution of new species."
Dr.Tanaka "Previously we've been able to combine materials collected from monsters to make *YELLOW*'roots'*/YELLOW*.Roots maintain the essence of the monsters they were created from, and we think that we may be able to use them alongside the *YELLOW*Ellondite*/YELLOW* in order to direct the evolutionary pathway of the Meeba!
*NPCNAME* "Let's get straight to it! Hopefully you already collected monster materials on your travels, if not could you collect some samples now for us.
Dr.Tanaka "When you have your samples ready, access the computer and combine them in the *YELLOW*GRAFTING menu*/YELLOW*. You can type exit in any menu to return to the previous menu.
Then, access the *YELLOW*DNA menu*/YELLOW*,

This solidifies your mission, *NAME*. Go forth and search the world for more *YELLOW*Ellondite!*/YELLOW* Collect samples from monsters from lands far and wide! We will study these Meeba and discover the nature of their power!
You should head over to *YELLOW*Karstbay*/YELLOW* - one of my colleagues has a lab over there. I'll send her over the information we've gathered so far and you'll be able to set up base there.
There's a boat that travels from *YELLOW*Rifton Beach*/YELLOW* to Karstbay regularly."

Prof. Fournier: Since Dr.Digby contacted me about the Ellondite and its affect on the protomeebium we've been trying to track down more locations of the rock.
Prof. Fournier: It seems to be a very specific meteoritic rock that has these properties - both the sample you collected and the one Rufus had are identical. 
Prof. Fournier: Other Ellondite samples we have don't appear to have an effect.
Prof. Fournier: So, now our next task is to study and identify this rock in order to track down other outcrops of it.
Prof. Fournier: Currently we know that the rock contains very *YELLOW*high levels of uranium*/YELLOW*.
Prof. Fournier: I had this *YELLOW*detector*/YELLOW* custom made to detect radiation from uranium in nearby rock outcrops.
Prof. Fournier: It shows high readings near the *YELLOW*limestone caves*/YELLOW*, so maybe there is an outcrop of the rock there.
